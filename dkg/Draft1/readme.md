## Detailed Ranking: All 15 Projects

### 🥇 Rank 1: EventChain - Real-Time Event Verification Network

**Composite Score: 9.47/10** | Market Urgency: CRITICAL

**One-Line Pitch:** A decentralized network where journalists, AI agents, and citizens collaboratively verify breaking news in real-time, with reputation-weighted consensus and NEURO rewards.

#### Market Validation
- **Misinformation damage:** $78B annually (2025 data)
- **Fact-check lag:** 4-24 hours currently → 5 minutes with DKG
- **Current bottleneck:** Only 4 professional fact-checkers handle global volume
- **Verification gap:** Cover <1% of viral misinformation; interventions only 16-22% effective at scale
- **Recent spike:** 179 deepfake incidents in Q1 2025 alone (19% more than all of 2024)

#### Why DKG Is Essential
Traditional fact-checking is centralized and slow. Real-time verification requires:
1. **Multi-source consensus** - DKG knowledge graphs enable weighted consensus across heterogeneous sources
2. **Reputation tracking** - Paranets allow reputation system that prevents Sybil attacks
3. **Micropayment economics** - x402 enables pay-per-query verification without platform lock-in
4. **Real-time collaboration** - DKG agents can coordinate instantly across borders

#### Technical Feasibility for Hackathon
- ✅ MVP: Browser extension + 3 verification agents + consensus calculator
- ✅ 2-3 week timeline achievable
- ✅ Seed with 10 verified journalists for demo
- ✅ Real data: Twitter API + fact-check databases available

#### Adoption Potential
- **Immediate users:** Social platforms desperate for verification (Twitter, TikTok, Instagram)
- **Revenue:** Micropayments from concerned readers ($0.10-1.00 per verification)
- **Network effects:** More verifiers → faster consensus → more users → more paying queries
- **Regulatory tailwind:** Governments now mandate platform verification (India Sept 2025 rule)

#### Implementation Roadmap (MVP)
```
Week 1: Set up DKG paranet for political claims + build browser extension
Week 2: Integrate 3 verification agents + implement consensus algorithm
Week 3: Deploy demo + seed with 10 verified journalists
Week 4: Test with real viral claims + measure verification speed
